<h1>Welcome to my blog!</h1>
<p>This is a space where I randomly post about things that interest me along with showcasing some of the <a href="/projects/">projects</a> that I am currently working on.</p>
<p>Being a self-taught developer I am open to any feedback, comments, and suggestions on any of my posts to improve and learn more - donâ€™t be shy to add in your comments.</p>

{% set postsCount = collections.posts | length %}
{% set latestPostsCount = postsCount | min(5) %}
<h2 class="pt-3">Latest Blog Posts</h2>

{% set postslist = collections.posts | head(-1 * 5) %}
{% set postslistCounter = postsCount %}
{% include "postslist.njk" %}

{% set morePosts = postsCount - 5 %}
{% if morePosts > 0 %}
<p class="text-end">{{ morePosts }} more post{% if morePosts != 1 %}s{% endif %} can be found in <a href="blog.njk">the archive</a>.</p>
