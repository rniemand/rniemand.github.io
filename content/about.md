# About

Welcome to my blog!

This is a space where I randomly post about things that interest me along with showcasing some of the projects that I am currently working on.

Being a self-taught developer I am open to any feedback, comments, and suggestions on any of my posts to improve and learn more - donâ€™t be shy to add in your comments.

I am originally from South Africa and immigrated to Canada in 2018 which was a huge culture shock, but in a good way for sure.

If you would like to see more of my projects feel free to head over to my [Github](https://github.com/rniemand) profile or [NuGet packages](/projects/) to see what I am working on.

Have a fantastic day!
