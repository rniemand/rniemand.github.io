<p>Today I would like to cover some simple security related monitoring in Home Assistant using the below components for under $5.00:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.aliexpress.com/wholesale?catId=523&amp;SearchText=reed+switch">Reed switch</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.banggood.com/3pcs-D1-Mini-Lite-V1_0_0-WIFI-Internet-Of-Things-Development-Board-Based-ESP8285-1MB-FLASH-p-1295716.html?imageAb=2&amp;p=5T250523689812015082&amp;akmClientCountry=CA&amp;cur_warehouse=CN">ESP8266 module</a> needs to be a D1 Mini if you are planning to use my enclosure</li>
<li><a href="https://www.banggood.com/Mini-Converter-DC-DC-Adjustable-Step-down-Power-Voltage-Module-p-1064472.html?p=5T250523689812015082">Buck converter</a> needs to be this size if using my enclosure</li>
<li><strong>Magnet</strong> for triggering the reed switch</li>
<li><strong>Wire</strong> any reasonably gauged wire should do</li>
<li>(optional) <a href="https://www.banggood.com/Anet-A8-DIY-3D-Printer-Kit-1_75mm-or-0_4mm-Support-ABS-or-PLA-or-HIPS-p-1130694.html?imageAb=2&amp;p=5T250523689812015082&amp;akmClientCountry=CA&amp;cur_warehouse=CN">3D printer</a> ~$220 (or just get someone to print the enclosure for you) - <a href="/blog/2017/2017-08-31/">I reviewed the Anet A8 here</a></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="the-idea">The idea</h2>
<p>I would like to receive push notifications as soon as my gate opens at home, so I can tell when my wife gets home in the afternoon, and to be alerted at night should someone try to lift it off the runners or force it open. I wanted to create a self-contained unit that I could print with my 3D printer, hide in the gate&#39;s motor enclosure and power it off the 12v backup battery of the gate.</p>
<p>This will be monitored as a <a href="https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/binary_sensor.mqtt">MQTT binary sensor</a> in Home Assistant, where a number of rules can be configured to fire upon the state change of the entity.</p>

<h2 id="the-arduino-code">The Arduino code</h2>
<p>I have pushed the required Arduino code to my <a href="https://github.com/rniemand/code-samples/tree/main/blog-posts/2017/Arduino%20Gate%20Alarm">github repository</a> under the name gate-alarm. The code is pretty simple, and should take only a few seconds to customize to your home network. The only changes you will need to make are shown below.</p>
<img src="./images/09/19-001.png" alt="" />
<ul>
<li>Configure your WiFi settings<ul>
<li>Enter in your WiFi name for <code>WLAN_SSID</code></li>
<li>Enter in your WiFi password <code>WLAN_PASS</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Configure your MQTT server settings<ul>
<li>At the moment the code does not support <code>TLS</code></li>
<li>Ensure that you change the <code>MQTT_CLIENT_NAME</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Once you have made the appropriate configuration changes for your home setup, upload the sketch to the ESP using the <a href="https://www.arduino.cc/en/software">Arduino software</a> and you are good to go.</p>

<h2 id="the-enclosure">The enclosure</h2>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: This step is optional. Thingiverse files <a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2542138">here</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Powering it off the battery was a lot simpler than using the 14v regulated power that comes into the main controller board of the gate, and less complex to hook up. The ESP8266 I have chosen requires 3.3v to operate and thus requires a buck converter to step down the 12-14v supplied by the gate&#39;s battery.</p>
<img src="./images/09/19-002.jpg" alt="" />
<p>The print came out pretty good, and all the components fit pretty snugly too.</p>

<img src="./images/09/19-005.jpg" alt="" />
<p>My wiring however, leaves a lot to be desired - and this was mainly due to the fact that I had soldered on the headers for the ESP8266 a while ago when working on another project. In the end I just broke off the one bit that was annoying me and soldered directly to the exposed pin :)</p>
<img src="./images/09/19-006.jpg" alt="" />
<p>This is what the final product looked like when all closed up:</p>

<h2 id="the-binary-sensor">The binary sensor</h2>
<p>Once the sketch has been uploaded you can power up the ESP using an external power source (USB or power from a battery using the buck converter). Using a tool like <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/mqttlens/hemojaaeigabkbcookmlgmdigohjobjm?hl=en">MQTTLens</a> subscribed to <code>security/reed_switch/#</code> you should see a couple of messages being published by the ESP during its startup phase. If you don&#39;t see these, try restarting the device, double checking your credentials (WiFi and MQTT) or re-uploading the code.</p>
<p>We will now create a new binary_sensor in my config/binary_sensors.yaml file as shown below:</p>
{% highlight "yaml" %}
- platform: mqtt
  state_topic: "security/reed_switch/node_kitchen"
  name: "Kitchen Door"
  qos: 0
  payload_on: "OPEN"
  payload_off: "CLOSED"
  device_class: opening
{% endhighlight %}
<p>If you have not done so, you will need to reference the config/binary_sensors.yamlfile in your main configuration.yaml file with the following statement:</p>
{% highlight "yaml" %}
binary_sensor: !include config/binary_sensors.yaml
{% endhighlight %}
<p>After restarting Home Assistant we get our sensor showing up.</p>
<img src="./images/09/19-008.png" alt="" />
<p>We can test that this sensor is working correctly by publishing an OPEN event on your devices channel.</p>
<img src="./images/09/19-009.png" alt="" />
<p>If you see the icon change to the open state everything is working as expected.</p>
<img src="./images/09/19-010.png" alt="" />

<h2 id="grouping-it">Grouping it</h2>
<p>I prefer having all my sensors appear as cards in Home Assistant, so I added the following group definition in my config/groups.yaml file:</p>
{% highlight "yaml" %}
security_kitchen_group:
  name: Kitchen Security
  entities:
    - binary_sensor.kitchen_door
{% endhighlight %}
<p>Restart Home Assistant...</p>
<img src="./images/09/19-011.png" alt="" />
<p>Then decided to create a new security view via the below view definition in my config/groups.yaml file:</p>
{% highlight "yaml" %}
kitchen_view:
  name: Kitchen
  view: yes
  icon: mdi:food-fork-drink
  entities:
    - device_tracker.niemandr_hwnxt
    - device_tracker.niemandr_raesphone
    - group.security_kitchen_group
{% endhighlight %}
<p>Another Home Assistant restart...</p>
<img src="./images/09/19-012.png" alt="" />
<p>That&#39;s much better.</p>

<h2 id="creating-an-alert">Creating an alert</h2>
<p>Next I would like to get an alert when the door opens or closes. I did this by adding in the following automation task in Home Assistant - in a new file called config/automation/kitchen_door_closed.yaml:</p>
{% highlight "yaml" %}
alias: Kitchen Door Closed
trigger:
  platform: state
  entity_id: binary_sensor.kitchen_door
  to: "off"
  from: "on"
action:
  service: notify.pushbullet
  data:
    message: "Kitchen door is closed"
    title: "Kitchen Door"
{% endhighlight %}
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note</strong> when using include_dir_list you need to have more than 1 file in the target directory - I tried using a single file and got all manner of errors from Home Assistant when loading my automation tasks\</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I reference my automation tasks in Home Assistant using the below statement paying special attention to the warning above:</p>
{% highlight "yaml" %}
automation: !include_dir_list config/automation/
{% endhighlight %}
<p>Another restart of Home Assistant and my new automation tasks shows up.</p>
<img src="./images/09/19-013.png" alt="" />
<p>Sending the CLOSED state via MQTTLens results in an alert via pushbullet and a state change on the door entity.</p>
<img src="./images/09/19-014.png" alt="" />
<p>When I open the door the state is reset</p>
<img src="./images/09/19-015.png" alt="" />
<p>Great success!</p>
