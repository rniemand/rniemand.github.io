<p>A while back I got brave and <a href="/blog/2017/2017-08-03/">changed the firmware on the Sonoff switch</a> connected to my lounge light to use it in my home automation. I followed <a href="https://github.com/arendst/Tasmota">these instructions</a> when uploading the firmware and was up and running in about 10 minutes.</p>
<p>Once I had everything connected back up it was time to interact with the light via my MQTT broker, and after Googling for the relevant commands I found <a href="https://github.com/arendst/Tasmota#tl-dr">them here</a>.</p>

<p>Which I have tabulated below:</p>
<table class="table table-sm table-hover table-striped w-auto">
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Command</th>
<th>Payload</th>
<th>Response</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><code>cmnd/my_device/power</code></td>
<td><code>&lt;empty&gt;</code></td>
<td>stat/my_device/POWER (ON|OFF)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>cmnd/my_device/power</code></td>
<td>on</td>
<td>stat/my_device/POWER ON</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>cmnd/my_device/power</code></td>
<td>off</td>
<td>stat/my_device/POWER OFF</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Once I knew the correct commands to send to the device I just needed to configure a unique name for it using the <code>configuration menu</code> provided by the <a href="https://github.com/arendst/Tasmota">Tasmota</a> firmware. As you can see below my device&#39;s name is loungeLight.</p>

<p>The sonoff will listen to events published on the <code>%prefix%/loungeLight/</code> topic, so in the case of sending a power on command to the light that would be <code>cmnd/loungeLight/power</code>. Knowing this I created the following flow in <a href="https://nodered.org/">Node-RED</a>.</p>

<p>This flow will publish a pre-defined payload to the below topic on my MQTT broker, which in this case will either be <code>on</code> or <code>off</code> depending on which button was pressed (or the value published by the scheduler).</p>

<p>To take my light automation to the next level as it were I am making use of <a href="https://github.com/biddster/node-red-contrib-schedex">schedex</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Scheduler for node-red which allows you to enter on/off times as 24hr clock (e.g. 01:10) or suncalc events (e.g. goldenHour). It also allows you to offset times and randomise the time within the offset.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This scheduler allows you to set your location (<code>longitude</code> and <code>latitude</code>) and provides some really awesome scheduling options as shown below.</p>

<p>This allows me to make use of the <code>sunsetStart</code> time to turn ON my light...</p>

<p>... and the sunrise time to turn it back <code>OFF</code>.</p>

<p>My lounge light is now fully automated thanks to Node-RED, Tasmota, schedexand a simple Sonoff switch!</p>
