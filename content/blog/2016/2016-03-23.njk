<p>
	I was playing around in JavScript needing to find 7â€™th position of a <code>(</code> within a long string. Messing about with the 
	<a href="https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_indexof.asp" target="_blank">indexOf()</a> and 
	<a href="https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_substring.asp" target="_blank">substring()</a> methods were a bit too cumbersome so 
	I came up with the following code snippet. Hopefully this saves you some time.
</p>

{% highlight "js" %}
function nthOccurrence(str, s, c) {
    var strlen = str.length;
    var matches = 0;

    for(i = 0; i < strlen; i++){
        if(str[i] === s) matches++;
        if(matches == c) return i;
    }
}
{% endhighlight %}
