Inspired by a [youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5vQFLjXk2I) I wanted to start communicating with my Arduino via a serial connection from my computer. Having a connection from my `computer` -> `Arduino` opens up a whole lot of new and exciting projects (e.g. external CPU / Memory display ...).

Following the video it was easy enough to get up and running, but a real pain having to open Visual Studio every time I wanted to change the commands I was sending to my Arduino. I decided to throw together a small .exe aptly named Serial Tester to allow for simpler communication from my side, and it looks something like this:

All the source code for the application is freely available on [GitHub here](https://github.com/rniemand/SerialTester).

Compiled versions of the program can be [found here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0BwmLFltkLtlRQUotOXFsWDVrQ3M).

Feel free to use / modify & share it, hopefully it helps you out also :)
